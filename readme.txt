== Description ==

Does your blog contain lots of comments that link to other blogs?  This plugin takes advantage of the comments left on your blog and performs pingbacks 
on the links in the comments left on your site.

- Goes through each comment on your blog and checks if the links on them can have a pingback performed on them.
- Runs every hour while the plugin is active.
- Webmasters usually accept the pingback if the comments are legit


== Installation ==

1.  Simply Copy the plugin to your plugin folder and active it.  
2.  Set how many pingbacks per hour to run, default is 50
